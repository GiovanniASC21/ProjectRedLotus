    <h1>Our Mission:</h1>
    <p id= theMission>The objective of Project Redd Lotus is to create a place of refuge and begin the path to health for those who struggle with drug addiction. 
        As a team we have come to recognize how difficult and scary it can be to, both, ask for help and 
        attempt to share your story. As a result, we have actively made it our mission to bring as much ease to this 
        process as possible </p>
